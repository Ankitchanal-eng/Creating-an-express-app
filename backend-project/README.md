# Simple Signup & Signin API ðŸš€

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ This is a small Node.js + Express project I made while learning backend stuff.  
Itâ€™s basically a super simple **signup** and **signin** API that stores users in memory (no database yet ðŸ˜…).  

## ðŸ“Œ What it does
- Lets you **signup** with a username and password
- Lets you **signin** with the same username and password
- If you login correctly, it gives you a random **token**
- All data is stored in memory (so it will reset when you restart the server)

## ðŸ›  How to run it
1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed
2. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
3. Go into the project folder:
    - cd your-repo-name
4. Install the dependencies:
    - npm install express
5. Start the server:
    - node index.js
6. Open Postman, Thunder Client, or any API testing tool and try:
    - POST http://localhost:3000/signup
    - POST http://localhost:3000/signin

## After updates in our code
- Creating an authenticated EP for authentincation of ueser.
- Then we generate the random tokens that is stored in database but it hit the database again & again for the tokens.
- Then we come up with the JWTs (jsonwebtokens) it do not store the token in DB All the `data` is stored in the token itself.
- we do not hit the `DATABASE` for authentincation.
